Known bugs:

1. vdifzipper.cpp: createVDIFHeader, number of channels instead of 1
2. copy data to each channel, at the moment only copying the first channel

3. Only support max. 4 channels at the moment due to bugs in vdifzipper
4. should loop through number of frames within second

Limitations:
1. 2-bits sampling
2. Only generate single-thread multi-channel VDIF
